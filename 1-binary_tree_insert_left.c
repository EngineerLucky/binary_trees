/**
* binary_tree_insert_left - The function Inserts a node as a left-child of
* of another in a binary tree.
* @parent: This is a  pointer to the node to insert the left-child in.
* @value: This is the value to store in the new node.
* Return: If parent is NULL or an error occurs - NULL.
* Otherwise - a pointer to the new node.
* Description: If parent already has a left-child, the new node
* takes its place and the old left-child is set as
* the left-child of the new node.
